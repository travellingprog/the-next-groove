When Marcell Detmann and Ben Klock were making techno cool again? When the aggro, \"bro\" side of Dubstep spearheaded the global takeover of festival EDM culture?\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Nas - Nas Is Like\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VC4ORS5n9Hg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nA last one: Do you remember when Swamp 81 was one of the coolest, trendiest labels and crews in underground club/electronic music?\n\n♪\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Fat Joe Reacts To NYC Rappers\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lk7deI0S9zs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nSwamp 81 was founded in the late 2000s by DMZ member and Dubstep pioneer, Loefah. Discouraged by the direction the genre had taken, he started his new label in order to push a sound that aligned itself more with his tastes. The first few releases - notably from Kryptic Minds - are characterized by a return to Dubstep's \"roots\" (the noisy, aggressive sound was overtaking the scene by then) : the dark and minimal, halftime style.\n\n![a big party](/cms-dev-content/uploads/wideimg.jpg)\n\nBut the label took a sudden turn in 2010 with its 5th release: Addison Groove's (aka Headhunter) 12\" record with Footcrab (and Dumbshit on the B-side). It became an immediate hit in the underground. The Juke-inspired, lo-fi, bassy, drum-machine track sounded like nothing else in Dubstep.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Elzhi - February\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZTcta21Dh0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />"
