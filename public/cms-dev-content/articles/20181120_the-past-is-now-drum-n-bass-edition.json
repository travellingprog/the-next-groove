  "body": "Anyone that has been following underground electronic music has certainly noticed that drum breaks have made a strong comeback these last couple of years, creeping themselves back into House and Techno. The current fascination with old school Jungle and Hardcore (I talk about the former in my last article). This has also made me realize how exciting the Jungle/DnB scene has been these last few years, with there being equal parts revivalism and forward thinking momentum. This year has been a wonderful one for the old school heads, and it has shown that there is still some juice left in the old sound. It has also shown that there is equally a healthy dose of experimentation, to see where Jungle and Dnb can go. So I thought I'd give a quick rundown of some interesting long-form releases that have piqued my interest throughout the year, and that are worth checking out.\n\nEarly 2018 gave us Street Beats Volume 2, a compilation of unearthed and previously-unreleased gems from about 1994. The compilation is brought to us by Basement Records, who've dug inside their own vaults to compile it, bringing together legends as Peshay, Photek (know as Truper at the time), and Source Direct (going by the name Oblivion). The label has been active since about 1991 and has recently shifted its focus towards re-releases of their own old school material, which had been only available on vinyl records. Their sound is one that I'm particularly fond of. The synth work and atmosphere is ethereal and melodic, backed up by a dark and heavy backbone, with the subbass and chaotic breaks manipulation. It's Jungle with remnants of Hardcore.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Peshay & Roger Johnson - Crazy Daydreams - Original Dubplate Mix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pzI7HyD_lA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Street Beats Volume 6AA\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uf64DViMCOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"LEFT\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\nâ™ª\n\nNext up we have Blunted Breaks Vol. 1, a compilation by Western Lore. The Bristol-based label has only been active for two years, yet it has made a big splash in the scene. Their roster includes some of the biggest names in \"new school\" old school Jungle: Tim Reaper, Coco Bryce, Dead Man's Chest, and Threshold. As the title suggests, they participate in revivalism (Dead Man's Chest covers for his releases on the label recall the old Dreamscape flyers), but they also take upon themselves to make the old sound new again. And while some tracks go in full retro mode like Coco Bryce's \"Adventures in Perception\" (only betraying itself due to the cleaner modern production), others, like Earl Grey's \"Levitate\", try to offer something that is more fresh. Nevertheless, the music is all good.\n\n<Tracklist tracks={[object Object],[object Object]} />"
