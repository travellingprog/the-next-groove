(+ March mixes and sets)","mainImage":"/cms-dev-content/uploads/titleimage-1-.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"A short reflection on the tendencies of modern underground electronic club music with my recommended mixes and sets from March in the spirit of that reflection","body":"One of the things that has defined underground club music during this decade (which is now coming to a close) is the almost complete deconstruction of its chronology.  I've somewhat already touched upon this on some [past](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181123_the-past-is-now-the-future-was-then) [entries](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181126_hardcore-will-never-die); but to briefly reiterate: the “new” (the “innovative”, the \"fresh\", the “future”, the “unknown”) is no longer the sole object of fixation; the “good” simply suffices. \n\nThe instant accessibility of 40 years of electronic club music has been a reality for the past 10+ years. DJs, producers and listeners (and not just the geekiest of them anymore) are now more and more aware of its history, digging deeper and deeper to see what can be discovered and rediscovered, introduced and brought back to life, imitated and reinterpreted, etc.\n\nEverything and anything can be new now. Young DJs making a living out of playing old boogie records isn't weird. In fact, you can probably book one for your house or techno night, and not many people will bat an eye. I don't know how many times I've heard a track on a set, thinking it was new, only to find out later that it had come out 25 years ago – and vice versa.\n\nThis thought came into my back during the mesmerizing first hour of Josey Rebelle's set in Toronto back in February – a completely obvious fact as to be almost laughably : for all the stylistic flourishes that club music has gone through in the past three decades or so, the backbone has always been, well, bass and drums (not to say “drum and bass”). That is what ties it all together.  Josey Rebelle seems to take that to heart; her set in Toronto consisted of stripped-back beats from these last three decades, mixing a breakbeat techno track into a minimalist UK funky track into an old school Chicago drum machine, hand-clap jam into a weighty, modern UK techno track (à la Kaizen) - all of it ready to make the bass bins burst into flames. It was her careful selection that made it seem like,  despite all of these tracks' different origins, in the end, it's all the same thing, and it all congealed into a cohesive-yet-varied sound.\n\nThose are the kind of DJs that are my favourites: the ones that have a particular vision, the ones who aim to achieve a particular sound or vibe, while taking music from different places (and now, from different eras). It's like how Ben UFO used to do back in the early part of this decade, mixing techno with carefully selected grime and dubstep tracks, underlining the similarities these seemingly disparate genres might have. Much more interesting than the DJs that just go through the Drumcode and Planet Rhythm catalogs, or the genre-hopping DJs with a severe lack of focus and no vision.\n\nInadvertently, this ended up being the underlying theme for most of my mixes selection for the month of March: _It's All About Bass and Drums Still, Isn't?_ I've always leaned towards the more stripped-back, “groove-based” side of club music, whether in house, dubstep or dnb, and these mixes really reflect that. They mostly consist of new “new” music (which I actively look for nowadays), mostly drawing from fresher styles of underground club music. As such, none of them really adhere to a genre, but each strive to reach a vibe showing how they interpret \"deep\", \"rude\", \"heavy\" electronic club music somewhat rooted in (or influenced by) UK sound system culture (hardcore, dnb, jungle, dubstep, etc).\n\n**Anna Morgan**'s ravey mix of hard drum, subby UK techno, new wave breakbeat techno (including a great remix of Mr Vegas' “Head High”) and weird 4x4 techno tracks from the likes of Object Blue and Quest?onmarc makes for a thrilling listen. **Shampain **keeps it ravey as well with his set on Noods Radio which ranges from leftfield, bright electro and 4x4 weighty stompers (including an awesome hard dance remix of Destiny Child's “Lose My Breath”). **Deena Abdelwahed **also leans close to UK techno sounds, but hones into a more “tribal”/oriental vibe, if you will. **Chants **takes that tribal vibe further into global bass and hard drum territory that would sure make the Nervous Horizon members grin like idiots. **Henry Greenleaf** does his own take on UK techno, influenced by old school dubstep's dubby vibes and Swamp 81's trippier subbass excursions. Toronto's **Ciel **goes into stripped-back and bassy (and sometimes heavy) underground house, techno and electro vibes for the city's new ISO Radio, including fresh tracks from great new producers like Nite Fleit, Klein Zage, Lauren Flax (her “Work Dat” has really been making the rounds, eh?) and herself. Following his big Keep Hush set, Manchester's **Strategy **has been on people's radars and he joins Chunky for his birthday special on NTS Radio to offer one hour of his own new, unreleased material: a concoction of funky, deep tech, old XXXY-like tracks, electro and Swamp 81-approved beats. Finally, **DJ Booga** from Germany offers a set of the modern, deeper ends of everything dnb (two-steppers, halftime, juke-inspired, dark atmopheric, etc, etc).\n\nThere you have it: eight great mixes and sets from March of new, groove-based ravey goodness. And a **DJ Katapila** set of Afrobeats and Afropop to top it off. His releases on Awesome Tapes From Africa are kind of shit to be honest, but he's a fine selector.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Anna Morgan - Kaizen Show 28th March 2019 (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fthe-kaizen-show-w-madam-x-28th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"LEFT\" size=\"SMALL\" />\n\n**\\*\\*HER SET STARTS AT AROUND 01:02:00\\*\\***\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Shampain- 12th March 2019 (Noods Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNoodsRadio%2Fshampain-12th-march-19%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Deena Abdelwahed - 14th March 2019 (Rinse FM)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/590333844&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Chants - JEROME Mixfile #420\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/588622329&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf - Fresh Kicks97\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/590537442&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Ciel - 8th March 2019 (ISO Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FISORadio%2Finternational-womens-day-ciel-8th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Strategy - Chunky's Birthday Special 17th March (NTS Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNTSRadio%2Fchunky-17th-march-2019%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />\n\n\\*\\*HIS SET STARTS AT AROUND 00:30:40\\*\\*\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Booga - DLPC #033\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/589365975&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"DJ Katapila - 12th March 2019 (Noods Radio)\" iframe={<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"120\" src=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&feed=%2FNoodsRadio%2Fdj-katapila-12th-march-19%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ></iframe>} />","name":"20190417_its-all-about-bass-and-drums-still-isnt-march-mixes-and-sets","urlPath":"/article/20190417_its-all-about-bass-and-drums-still-isnt-march-mixes-and-sets"},{"publicationDate":"Nov 20, 2018","title":"The Past is Now : Drum N Bass Edition","mainImage":"/cms-dev-content/uploads/pastisnow01.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"Drum breaks have made a strong comeback these last couple of years, creeping themselves back into House and Techno","body":"Anyone that has been following underground electronic music has certainly noticed that drum breaks have made a strong comeback these last couple of years, creeping themselves back into House and Techno. The current fascination with old school Jungle and Hardcore (I talk about the former in my last article). This has also made me realize how exciting the Jungle/DnB scene has been these last few years, with there being equal parts revivalism and forward thinking momentum. This year has been a wonderful one for the old school heads, and it has shown that there is still some juice left in the old sound. It has also shown that there is equally a healthy dose of experimentation, to see where Jungle and Dnb can go. So I thought I'd give a quick rundown of some interesting long-form releases that have piqued my interest throughout the year, and that are worth checking out.\n\nEarly 2018 gave us Street Beats Volume 2, a compilation of unearthed and previously-unreleased gems from about 1994. The compilation is brought to us by Basement Records, who've dug inside their own vaults to compile it, bringing together legends as Peshay, Photek (know as Truper at the time), and Source Direct (going by the name Oblivion). The label has been active since about 1991 and has recently shifted its focus towards re-releases of their own old school material, which had been only available on vinyl records. Their sound is one that I'm particularly fond of. The synth work and atmosphere is ethereal and melodic, backed up by a dark and heavy backbone, with the subbass and chaotic breaks manipulation. It's Jungle with remnants of Hardcore.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Peshay & Roger Johnson - Crazy Daydreams - Original Dubplate Mix\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_pzI7HyD_lA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Street Beats Volume 6AA\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uf64DViMCOA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"LEFT\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n♪\n\nNext up we have Blunted Breaks Vol. 1, a compilation by Western Lore. The Bristol-based label has only been active for two years, yet it has made a big splash in the scene. Their roster includes some of the biggest names in \"new school\" old school Jungle: Tim Reaper, Coco Bryce, Dead Man's Chest, and Threshold. As the title suggests, they participate in revivalism (Dead Man's Chest covers for his releases on the label recall the old Dreamscape flyers), but they also take upon themselves to make the old sound new again. And while some tracks go in full retro mode like Coco Bryce's \"Adventures in Perception\" (only betraying itself due to the cleaner modern production), others, like Earl Grey's \"Levitate\", try to offer something that is more fresh. Nevertheless, the music is all good.\n\n<Tracklist tracks={[object Object],[object Object]} />","name":"20181120_the-past-is-now-drum-n-bass-edition","urlPath":"/article/20181120_the-past-is-now-drum-n-bass-edition"},{"publicationDate":"Nov 18, 2018","title":"Hardcore Will Never Die.","mainImage":"/cms-dev-content/uploads/hardcorewillneverdie01.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"In fact, in many ways, it could be thriving.","body":"As I was reading through Simon Reynolds' blog, I stumbled upon an interesting blog post that Reynolds himself linked to, this one from a blog by a certain Pearsall. In this particular post, Pearsall shares his own mix of old school breakbeat Hardcore made by new players in these last couple of years. As I've said in my previous post about today's unabashed retroism, recent years have been fruitful for all different styles of music made by artists whose eyes are fixated on the rear view mirror, some of whom are happy with not going much further than imitation. Pearsal acknowledges this:\n\n> _\"If we're honest, most of the tracks betray precisely no influence from musical developments of the last 20+ years, something that, to me, brings up many interesting questions_\n>\n> _This is because the original hardcore rave sound arose in a musical, social, and political context that is very different from the one we experience today, a whole confluence of events of events that cannot be recreated. It also can't be ignored that the scene was like a huge hive mind focused on relentless change and innovation - the speed of change was breathtaking, and probably without much parallel in recent musical history._\n>\n> _So it's an interesting paradox with tracks like the ones I've selected for this mix, in that they are very consciously imitating a moment in time when musicians were desperately trying not to imitate, but to innovate and keep progressing. It's a bit like modern guitar bands still reaching for that classic garage punk sound, in a sense.\"_\n\nThat last paragraph is very telling. As I've previously said, I attribute this \"hardcore revivalism/retroism\" to the fact that we have virtually all of the music at our disposal with the help of the Internet. For anyone, music from the past is, or can be, just as relevant as the music from today. Unearthing older music brings the same rewards of \"newness\" as digging into new releases. Consider, for example, the recent and ongoing fascination that young people (Millennials and teenage Gen-Zers) have for City Pop, Japan's funk-glamour-neon-cheesy pop from the 80s, a previously unknown and forgotten genre.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Kikuchi Momoko - Adventure\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/il-6ZqPkgGo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nAs to the question, \"Why Hardcore?\". Well, it seems as if those early rave days have been romanticized and mythologized by everyone that was a part of it. The \"being there\". The \"being part of something new and special\". The \"feeling of freedom and reverie\". For someone that is, say, 20 years old today, there might be some form of longing for those days, reading testimonies and looking through the pictures of a past youth celebrating music, life, drugs, and love. And as Pearsall notes, between 1990 and 1995, things were moving and evolving so fast, that the old school Hardcore sound only lasted a little less than three years before it split into the Jungle and Happy Hardcore scenes. Out of sheer luck, others were born just in time and were at the right place to live through that era, experience firsthand. And it came and went. Sure, the sound lived on in the two mentioned genres, but it's not exactly the same, is it? Old school Hardcore has a specificity to it, its own vibe. So why not bring it back? Why not give it one more life? Maybe that specific sound has more left into it, maybe not everything has been exhausted from it? Maybe by recreating those sounds there's a way to bring back the energy of that era - to find whatever it is some are looking for.","name":"20181120_hardcore-will-never-die","urlPath":"/article/20181120_hardcore-will-never-die"},{"publicationDate":"Nov 06, 2018","title":"My Favourite Unreleased Old-School Dubstep Tracks","mainImage":"/cms-dev-content/uploads/oldschooldubstep01.jpg","category":"PLAYLISTS","summary":"My favourite unreleased tracks from the early Dubstep era, tracks that I still go back to","body":"Coming off from my last article about the first two Dubstep Allstars entries, I thought I would share some of my favourite unreleased tracks from the early Dubstep era, tracks that I still go back to. Most of these I heard listening to sets from the likes of Youngsta, Hatcha (our two protagonists from my last article), and also DJ Chefal, Cyrus, Slaughter Mob, etc. \n\nFor better or for worse, an important part of Dubstep is the dubplate culture it inherited from Jungle and DnB (who, in their turn, took it from the Jamaican soundsystem tradition). Briefly put, dubplates are unreleased tracks pressed on 10-inch records, not for commercial release, but for producers to hand out to DJs as exclusives, sometimes only making a couple of copies. This practice was encouraged by two things: 1) DJs trying to \"one-up\" their peers and competitors; and 2) the constant search for the new by DJs and ravers/listeners alike. Alex Nagshineh further explains what dubplate culture is in this article.\n\nSo let's get right to the list. As they are unreleased tracks, all of these have been ripped straight from archived radio sets. So you'll hear voices from MCs, interacting with the listeners. The last track, the Digital Mystikz remix, is probably the ultimate dubplate, of which there are only two copies (one owned by Mala himself, and the other by Joe Nice). It is the Holy Grail of dubplates, if you will.\n\nThe producers making up this list (Skream, Benga, Loefah, Mala, Coki, D1) are the main producers that shaped the \"Croydon Sound\"(in turn, shaping what we now recognize as being \"Dubstep\") making these beats mainly for Hatcha and Youngsta. To my knowledge, they date from 2003 to 2006.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Skream - Boks\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WTdFt_O803E\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />\n\nThe End","name":"20181120_my-favourite-unreleased-old-school-dubstep-tracks","urlPath":"/article/20181120_my-favourite-unreleased-old-school-dubstep-tracks"},{"publicationDate":"Oct 19, 2018","title":"A Look Back - Dubstep Allstars: A Movement Takes Shape","mainImage":"/cms-dev-content/uploads/dubstepallstars.png","category":"MUSINGS","summary":"For everyone that was locked in to Hatcha's selection of underground bass music, they were listening to an early rendition of Dubstep","body":"> _\"For emerging scenes that have a newness about them, \\[that are] kind of unique and fresh, vital in that way that dubstep was, and in that way that grime was, in that way that 2-step garage was, specialism is really, really important, because it's that specialism that allows the music to unravel and develop. So with a genre like dubstep, there \\[were] DJs like Youngsta and Hatcha, who both produced occasional records, but were essentially specialist DJs. And they put a lot of initially quite disparate music into context as being one thing. And it was that which really honed the sound and made it what it was. It helped people identify with it, I think. It made the music less impenetrable.\"_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"RIGHT\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\- Ben UFO, Red Bull Music Academy Lecture, 2014\n\nLet's go back 15 years.  If you were living in London, you might have been able to pick up the signal from the then-pirate radio station, Rinse FM, at home or in your car. And you might have caught DJ Hatcha's show. You listen closely. The music is dark and bassy. Energetic, earthy and esoteric. It's stripped back for the most part - the percussion and the rumbling bass - with minimal instrumentation put on top, usually a sample taken from whatever exotic/\"ethnic\"/oriental music. And you can faintly hear some 2-step Garage influences in the beat patterns, but the music has already begun to stray away from it.\n\nAnd on top you hear the playful and almost nonsensical chatter of MCs Crazy D (mostly) and Beezy.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n_\"Come on Hatcha! Take them to the jungle! Come on do it! Don't just say it, DO IT!\"_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n_\"Deeper and darker we go!

Ongie Bongie!\"_\n\n![In the studio](/cms-dev-content/uploads/dubstepallstars02.jpg)\n\nFor everyone that was locked in to the show way back in 2003 - from the \"deep heads\" recording the set on cassette, to the likes of the Digital Mystikz, smoking a spliff in their car - listening to Hatcha's selection of underground bass music, that he and Crazy D would call \"Tribal\" or \"Ongie bongie\", what they probably didn't know was that they were listening to the early renditions of what would soon be called Dubstep.\n\nAs Ben UFO (founder of Hessle Audio, one of the most celebrated underground UK labels) says in the above quote, Hatcha was a specialist, honing into a particular sound. In the early 2000s, a whole bunch of producers and DJs, with backgrounds in UK Garage, started making darker, rawer beats at 140 bpm, often with stylistic influences taken from the darker ends of Jungle and Drum n Bass. In 2003, 15 years ago, Dubstep and Grime hadn't yet crystallized into defined genres.  There were different styles going about within the \"140 sound\" diaspora; from the breakstep garage sound, to dark garage à la DJ Narrows, to sublow, eski beat and dubstep. The Dubstep (dubby 2-step garage) term, from what I understand, was initially used to describe Horsepower Productions' output and all of the  music influenced by it, or which resembled it.","name":"20181120_a-look-back-dubstep-allstars-a-movement-takes-shape","urlPath":"/article/20181120_a-look-back-dubstep-allstars-a-movement-takes-shape"},{"publicationDate":"Oct 04, 2018","title":"Old School House Music (made in the 21st Century)","mainImage":"/cms-dev-content/uploads/oldschoolhouse.jpg","category":"MIXES","summary":"What is House?

The Future was then.","mainImage":"/cms-dev-content/uploads/georgeclanton01.jpg","category":"MUSINGS","summary":" I think it's safe to say that retro sounds are no longer particular or audacious stylistic choices in music.","body":"It's the evening, and I'm listening to George Clanton's newly released Slide. It's an enjoyable synthpop album. Great melodies, cool sounds, yadda, yaddda, yadda. However, what is striking to me about this album, is how its retro sound isn't striking. The synth work and the sampled drum breaks entirely assume a 90s vibe, but never does it sound novel.  I think it's safe to say that retro sounds are no longer particular or audacious stylistic choices in music. It's as if we've accepted the sounds from  the past into our current lives. They are just a palette among many. In Google Play, in Spotify, in Youtube, I have at my fingertips an immense collection of music from every era. When it comes to modern music (i.e. from the 60s onwards), everything falls into a sort of musical mosaic while listening on a digital platform.\n\nHow could it not? So many modern acts borrow directly from the past. Sure, there are some modern tendencies, notably when it comes to vocal melodies and vocal delivery in pop music, that distinguish them from older styles. But when it comes to song arrangements and instrumentation, past works serve as inspiration, to the point where it's not just inspiration but imitation at times.\n\nI think of electronic music right now. I wrote the article highlighting what I considered as \"the new Hardcore\" in UK rave music. I also consider it as being \"new\" and \"fresh\". But let's just think about everything else. Look at House music. In 2006, Loefah said in a dubstep documentary that \"House and Techno have been doing the same thing for 10-15 years\". It's 2018 now, and House is still the same. Same tempos, same chord progressions. Mostly, look at Lo-fi  House, probably the biggest underground electronic genre in the last few years outside of Big Room/Festival Techno (is that still considered \"underground\"?). The genre is shamelessly retro, not only in its sound but in the names that some producers have given themselves (DJ Seinfeld? Ross from Friends?). It's biggest hit is probably DJ Boring's Winona.","name":"20181120_the-past-is-now-the-future-was-then","urlPath":"/article/20181120_the-past-is-now-the-future-was-then"},{"publicationDate":"Aug 29, 2018","title":"Reggae Gold?

","body":"This year marks the 25th anniversary of VP Records' flagship Reggae Gold series. While compilations of recent music seem like an antiquated idea, I think it actually suits genres like Dancehall and Reggae, where so much music is released every year, and where so much of it can, in honesty, be discarded. Sure, the same can be some for probably most genres, but the Dancehall scene has the tendency to churn out a ridiculous amount of music, more so than in any other genre I've encountered. And for a genre that has always been singles-focused (more so in the last 20 years), a compilation can serve as an entry point into what people are listening, and as an introduction to new names in the scene that one might have missed. VP Records are not only an influential label, but they're also regarded as fine selectors.\n\nNow, maybe's it's because I'm beginning to be out of touch with the current tastes in the Reggae world, but I felt like this year's Reggae Gold entry to be underwhelming. Though, it's not without its high points. Hoodcelebrityy's hit, Walking Trophy, is as catchy and charming as it is earnest. And so is Dovey Magnum's Bawl Out (although in a more hyper-sexual manner). Estelle's Better is as good as any modern R'n'B number from the likes of Rihanna, Drake, or any of your favourite US-based artists. And lastly, Sheensea's Nothing Dem Nuh Have Ova Me is a perfect example of why she's one of my favourite current singers in Dancehall","name":"20181120_reggae-gold-no-ragga-song-spesh","urlPath":"/article/20181120_reggae-gold-no-ragga-song-spesh"}],"links":{"previousPage":null,"nextPage":"/page/2"}}
