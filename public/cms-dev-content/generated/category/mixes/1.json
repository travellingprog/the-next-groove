What, exactly, is Techno? And how can people distinguish one from the other so assuredly?\n\nLet me try and give a description. Techno is machine music. Usually instrumental, it has a steady, repetitive rhythm; it's not too slow, but not too fast. It can sound grey and atonal, or even, at times, bright and melodic. Created in the 80s in Detroit, it takes massive influences from West Coast P-Funk and 70s German electronic music, taking the German motorik pulse and putting it in a dance/club environment.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"\" />\n\n_**♪♪ 'Cause House is a feeling! ♪♪**_\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Soulful House Showcase Mix\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/509637738&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<Tracklist tracksStr={[{\"startTime\":\"00:00\",\"artist\":\"Quentin Harris\",\"trackName\":\"My Joy\"},{\"startTime\":\"04:21\",\"artist\":\"Full Intention\",\"trackName\":\"I'll Be Waiting (Gray & Pearn Remix)\"},{\"startTime\":\"7:48\",\"artist\":\"Hardsoul feat.

Discouraged by the direction the genre had taken, he started his new label in order to push a sound that aligned itself more with his tastes. The first few releases - notably from Kryptic Minds - are characterized by a return to Dubstep's \"roots\" (the noisy, aggressive sound was overtaking the scene by then) : the dark and minimal, halftime style.\n\n![a big party](/cms-dev-content/uploads/wideimg.jpg)\n\nBut the label took a sudden turn in 2010 with its 5th release: Addison Groove's (aka Headhunter) 12\" record with Footcrab (and Dumbshit on the B-side). It became an immediate hit in the underground. The Juke-inspired, lo-fi, bassy, drum-machine track sounded like nothing else in Dubstep.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Elzhi - February\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZTcta21Dh0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />","name":"20180926_test-title","urlPath":"/article/20180926_test-title"}],"links":{"previousPage":null,"nextPage":null}}
